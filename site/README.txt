1) start server with ru.json / en.json 
open command prompt (cli) and navigate inside 'server' folder of your project
In command line type: node app

2) install dependencies
open other command line and navigate inside 'site' folder of your project

3) inside 'site' folder of your project: 
   type npm install

4) run static site using node.js (other / second):
   node kicker
Note: I created the kicker.js in order to run static file in node.js 

5) Open browser and open site : localhost:8080
Note: default route is index.html. so localhost:8080/index.html = localhost:8080
To open a file in a browser type: localhost:8080/index.html

Enjoy coding!
